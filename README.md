# KnowlDev

The idea behind this project is in accordance with the Rural Development Programme of European Union. We have found out that one area in particular that needs a lot of encouragement is growth competitiveness which is hampered by the slow transfer of knowledge and innovation regarding environmental oriented legislation and the limited usage of Information Technology on bridging this gap. We decided to call this project KnowlDev which is short for Knowledge and Development. At KnowlDev we have created a web application that offers students, researchers and basically everyone who is interested a fast access to a selected library of books that deal with the Rural Development.

Objectives of this online library store are:

Promote papers, researches and books written by CULS academics and students
Publish renowned titles from recognized worldwide authors
Share books through our platform
Create and manage local meetups that would raise awareness on the issue
With this approach we are confident that we can attract more and more people to join in our platform, making it feasible for us to focus more on improving the quality of our products.
